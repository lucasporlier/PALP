## Simple front-office website
Based on quick connection and easy integration to already existing projects.
Fully responsive, with all the pre-styled `<elements>` you would usually expect plus slick animations --- but static for now.

>*Made as an exercise for a workshop featuring [Pôle Emploi](pole-emploi.fr) to replace their very __dense__ website, this one may not be updated anymore, so feel free to fork it.*
